# EstimationOfPhotometricRedshiftUsingDL
The objective of the project is to find the Photometric Redshift from the data extracted from SDSS server. Data is extracted from server through SQL. The extracted data is sampled with many machine learning and deep learning-based algorithms to calculate the best accurate photometric redshift values.
